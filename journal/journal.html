		<h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
		<p>
			Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

		<h2>June 2, 2012</h2>

			My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>cell phone,<br />
				<li>iPod,<br />
				<li>digital camera,<br />
				<li>a protein bar.<br />
			</ul>
			
		<p>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q></p>
		<h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
		<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>

			<blockquote>Passing cars,<br />
			When you can't see,<br />
			May get you, A glimpse,<br />
			Of eternity.<br />
			</blockquote>

		<p>I definitely will <em>not</em> be passing any cars.</p>

			Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.
